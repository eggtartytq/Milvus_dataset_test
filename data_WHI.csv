Values of 1 would indicate 100% adherence.  A participant with a value of 5.97 or 597%, for example, would have taken 215 pills in a 36 day period according to the bottle collection information in the database.   That would be an entire bottle and probably indicates an error with the data collection. Some possible errors include data entry errors in collection dates or bottle weights, or a bottle collected as empty in error.  It could also be that the woman was actually taking more pills than she should have in that time period.  You may choose to either throw out values that seem unreasonable or max them out at 100%"
